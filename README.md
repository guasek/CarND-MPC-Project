# The Model

The state of the vehicle is being provided by the simulator. It consists of:

* x - vehicle x position
* y - vehicle y position
* psi - vehicle orientation
* speed - vehicle current speed

Acutators we solve for are:

* delta - steering angle (wee need to have the opposite value in order to steer the vehicle)
* a - acceleration

We use a kinematic model described in the class:

![alt text](./model.png "Model equations")

where:
* dt - timestep
* Lf - distance of the vehicle's front from the center of gravity

# Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

## dt

I've tried values ranging from 0.05 to 0.25. Using lower ones ended up with very frequent actuations which resulted in vehicle's oscilation around the trajectory.
Using larger values resulted in smoother path but the car had problems with passing narrow turns.

## N

Describes how many timesteps dt are we using in our prediction. When I tried large N values the model lost it's accuracy. 

# Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing

I changed the coordinates received from the simulator from map space to vehicle's space in order to fit a third degree polynomial.

# Model Predictive Control with Latency

I've predicted initial vehicle state 100ms into the future before I pass the vector to solver in order to compensate for steering lag. I could also try to use some sort of averaging over the next few steps in order to further improve the actuations.

## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) == 0.14, but the master branch will probably work just fine
  * Follow the instructions in the [uWebSockets README](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/blob/master/README.md) to get setup for your platform. You can download the zip of the appropriate version from the [releases page](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/releases). Here's a link to the [v0.14 zip](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/archive/v0.14.0.zip).
  * If you have MacOS and have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed you can just run the ./install-mac.sh script to install this.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt`
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/) or the [Github releases](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/releases) page.
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`. 
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [CppAD](https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/)
  * Mac: `brew install cppad`
  * Linux `sudo apt-get install cppad` or equivalent.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.
